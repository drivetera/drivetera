- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the complexities of climate dynamics, atmospheric modeling, and Earth system interactions. My research focuses on aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions and their impacts on global monsoon systems, rainfall variability, and climate change. I’m also passionate about making climate science more accessible through education and outreach.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in polar climate modeling and cloud microphysics to support my research on how aerosols influence monsoon precipitation patterns. Additionally, I'm diving deeper into data visualization techniques in Python and R to make complex climate data more interpretable.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving atmospheric dynamics, aerosol interactions, and any initiatives that aim to bridge climate science and public awareness. I’m particularly interested in working with others on open-source climate data tools and educational resources to demystify climate models and Earth systems science.
